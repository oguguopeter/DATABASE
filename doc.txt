Title: NoSQL vs. SQL - A Comparison
Subtitle: MongoDB vs. SQL

[Slide 2]

Title: NoSQL - MongoDB
- NoSQL database
- Schema-less structure
- Uses flexible, JSON-like documents for data representation
- Supports horizontal scalability
- Offers high performance for read-heavy workloads

[Slide 3]

Title: SQL - Relational Database
- Structured Query Language (SQL) based database
- Relational structure with tables, rows, and columns
- Uses predefined schema for data representation
- Supports complex querying and joins
- Provides strong data consistency and integrity

[Slide 4]

Title: Comparison
1. Data Model:
   - MongoDB: Document-oriented
   - SQL: Relational model

2. Schema:
   - MongoDB: Schema-less, flexible
   - SQL: Predefined schema, rigid

3. Scalability:
   - MongoDB: Horizontal scalability with sharding
   - SQL: Vertical scalability with more powerful hardware

4. Querying:
   - MongoDB: Supports rich queries and indexing
   - SQL: Offers powerful querying capabilities with SQL language

5. Data Integrity:
   - MongoDB: Eventual consistency, flexible data updates
   - SQL: Strong data consistency and integrity with ACID properties

[Slide 5]

Title: Conclusion
- MongoDB and SQL serve different purposes based on the requirements of the project.
- MongoDB is well-suited for flexible, scalable, and high-performance applications.
- SQL databases excel in structured data, complex querying, and maintaining strong data integrity.
